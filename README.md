# LABORATORY-TEMPLATING

This laboratory is my testing and experimentation with the templating engine such as **Nunjucks** and **Handlebars**. For this project, I have used **NX** for creating the workspace and **Express** for creating the api. The two engine will be connected to my API using middlewares. I tried this two templating for testing if there were any difference between the two. I have found that, they work the same but with a different syntax. Through my reading of those template, I also discover many other templating engine such as Pug but once you master one, you can switch to an other one easily.

## Experiences

#### Handlebars (API1)

#### Nunjuck (API2)
